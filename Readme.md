# Information Security Lab at ETH Zurich


### General Information

This is the repo of the infosec lab projects, of which the topics include [Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://github.com/jiaqingxie/infosec-lab/tree/main/module_1), [Cryptographic Reductions](https://github.com/jiaqingxie/infosec-lab/tree/main/module_2), [Introduction to Tamarin Proofs](https://github.com/jiaqingxie/infosec-lab/tree/main/module_3), [Software Security](https://github.com/jiaqingxie/infosec-lab/tree/main/module_4), [DDoS Attacks & Defenses](https://github.com/jiaqingxie/infosec-lab/tree/main/module_5), [Trusted Execution Environments](https://github.com/jiaqingxie/infosec-lab/tree/main/module_6), and [Security and Privacy in Machine Learning](https://github.com/jiaqingxie/infosec-lab/tree/main/module_7). You can test on those submission files for fun. 

This is my own version of infosec in HS 2022. If you want to check other people's infosec happened in other semesters, you can refer to those repos for convenience. From my perspective, they are generally helpful and reliable, so a kind star to their repos :) 

### Repos

HS 2021: [Toroto006](https://github.com/Toroto006/InfoSecLab-ETHZ-HS21), [schwyzer](https://github.com/schwyzer/ISL-ETHZ-2021), [begeli](https://github.com/begeli/information-security-lab-projects)



Also by convenience to the lab sheets, I have moved the handouts outside which are located under the main folder.
If you find those information helpful, I would appreciate if you can star this repo. Thank you :) 

### Important information

Please note that the second part of network security projects have shown a large fluctuation in results. We didn't find an optimal solution which leads to 100 points. My apologize to this. Thinking about how to differentiate level 1, level 2 and level 3 attack might be a good directon.
